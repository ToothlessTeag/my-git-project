        <h2>Introduction to Tigers</h2>
        <p>
            Tigers (<i>Panthera tigris</i>) are the largest members of the cat family and are renowned for their majestic beauty, strength, and power. These solitary hunters are known for their distinctive orange coats with black stripes, although rare color variations like white tigers also exist. Sadly, they are an endangered species, with fewer than 4,000 individuals remaining in the wild.

        <h2>Why are Tigers Important?</h2>
        <p>
            Tigers play a critical role in maintaining the health of ecosystems. As apex predators, they help control the population of prey animals, ensuring a balance that prevents overgrazing and preserves the biodiversity of their habitats. Protecting tigers is not just about saving one speciesâ€”it helps safeguard entire ecosystems.
